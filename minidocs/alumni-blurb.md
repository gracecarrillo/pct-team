Leeds is one of four universities involved in the development of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) funded by the Department for Transport (DfT). The tool is being used to inform investment in sustainable transport infrastructure, primarily cycle paths, by showing which areas of the country have the greatest potential for the uptake of cycling. The tool shows which roads should be prioritised to create joined-up cycle networks as part of the Government's target to double the number of trips cycled by 2025.

The PCT is the DfT-endorsed too for developing local cycling and walking infrastructure plans (LCWIPs) and is already being used by dozens of local authorities and consultancies including Transport for Greater Manchester and Systra to create evidence-based strategic cycle networks. Lead developer Dr Robin Lovelace, from the Leeds Institute for Transport Studies explains: "The PCT allows decision makers to be confident that investment in cycling will be spent sensibly, in the right places and as part of a joined-up cycling network."

The study has become part of Government legislation in the Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Strategy (CWIS). The newly-launched CWIS is part of a Â£1.2 billion government plan to make cycling the natural choice for short trips.

The PCT is the first open source transport model that is publicly accessible and works on the national level. To see the PCT in action for Leeds (or any area of your choice) go to www.pct.bike and click on a region that interests you. For further information on the project see an academic article describing the tool (Lovelace et al., 2017).
