## Description

This Propensity to Cycle Tool Hackathon is designed for advanced users and developers of the tool to share ideas, use-cases and skills. The aim is to build know-how of the tool and how it can be used, modified and extended to improve its ability to help provide an accessible evidence-based for transport planning.

Attendees will likely split into teams at the outset to work on issues such as:

- How to best make use of data generated by the PCT
- New scenarios (e.g. 'Go York')
- Modifications to the PCT user interface
- Extensions to the PCT (e.g. rail or cycle parking)
- Modification to the code (e.g. refactor for database, sf support or conversion of stata code to R)
- Creation of a short video explaining some of the lesser-known features of the PCT

It is hoped that the knowledge learned will be shared beyond the event via write-ups, workshops and extensions to the PCT by attendees.

## Prerequisites

R must be installed, in addition to the development version of the stplanr package: https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr

It will help if you have Git installed on your computer.
With it installed the following commands will download all files you need to reproduce the tool:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
# clone the pct data creation scripts
git clone https://github.com/npct/pct-demo
```

If you want to work on the 'full' PCT you'll need these on your laptop before the hackathon.

To download the input data, install git lfs from [GitHub](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and run the following lines of code from an appropriate shell (e.g. bash on Linux or Windows Powershell):

```bash
git lfs install # check lfs is working
# clone the data (warning - large)
git clone https://github.com/npct/pct-inputs.git # raw input files
git clone https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-national.git # national outputs
git clone https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-R.git # regional outputs used by pct-shiny
```

The contents of the regional outputs are used by the code in pct-shiny, which can be downloaded with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/npct/pct-shiny.git 
```

## Agenda

See full draft agenda here: https://github.com/npct/pct/blob/master/minidocs/pct-hackathon.Rmd

The rough running order of the event will be as follows:

### Getting up to speed 9:00-10AM (optional)

The aim of this section is familiarise attendees with the PCT. Optional for experienced users.

- Policy relevance and the type of questions we want to answer (15 minutes)

- Open question and answer and a chance for people to ask technical questions (15 minutes)

- Meet and greet and team formation - talk to person next to you and decide what you want to get out of it (15 minutes over coffee) 

- Coffee break, discussion and set-up (15 minutes)

### Learning to use and hack the PCT (10 - 12)

- Live demo and where we're at with the Propensity to Cycle Project and quick demo (Robin - 15 minutes)

The aim of this section is to learn skills needed for the hackathon. By the end of it everyone should be in a team with a plan.

- Split session. Getting up to speed with the tool - Malcolm to do tech explanation for people with PCT installed, others to demonstrate use cases for people without (45 minutes)

- Free time to play with the tool, test hacks and network to finalise teams (1 hr)

**Lunch: 12 - 1PM**

### The hackathon (1 - 4pm)

This is where the bulk of the work will take place

- Reconvene to hear and discuss team ideas (30 minutes, ~5 min per team)

- Free time for hackathon (2 hrs)

### Feedback (4 - 4:30PM)

- Presentation of hacks and discussion
