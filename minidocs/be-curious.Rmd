Design a cycle-friendly city

Up to 10 words
Description of your activity *

This activity will give the public an interactive insight into high-impact and international research into sustainable transport being led by the University of Leeds.
It will guide attendees through a role-playing game where they design cycling infrastructure for Leeds or another city of their choice, with options including Accra or Kathmandu.
Results will be saved on-line and disseminated for future engagement.
Options range from new 'cycle superhighways' and junctions redesigned for safety to simple measures like new cycle parking points.
The activity will be based on the Department for Transport funded Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit (CyIPT).

Aimed at the public audience making a clear link to the theme 'We are International' (up to 50 words)

This activity will put you in control of a city's investment in cycling infrastructure up to 2050.
For Leeds or elsewhere you will decide what is built and where.
In the process you'll learn how evidence can help prioritise investment for a 'zero carbon' future internationally.
