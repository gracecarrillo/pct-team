# Introduction

## What is saving the world?

Many ways of saying the same thing:

> - 'Policy-led research'
> - 'Impact'
> - 'Socially beneficial research'
> - Don't be evil (Google)

My definition: **building an evidence-base for sustainable systems**.

- In the context of climate change that means:

> - Building an evidence-base to transition away from fossil fuels

- But could also be interpretted in terms of other (quantifiable) social/economic/environmental indicators

## An example from Sheffield

- From @lovelace_assessing_2011 - how to reduce transport-related emissions?
    - Source: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.051

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```


## What is Geographic Data Science?

> - And how does it differ from spatial modelling?

- How does it differ from good old 'GIS'?
- What does the science in the title mean?
- Why the focus on data rather than information

Code example:

```{r}
d = frame_data(
  ~Attribute, ~GIS, ~GDS,
  "Home disciplines", "Geography", "Geography, Computing, Statistics",
  "Software focus", "Graphic User Interface", "Code",
  "Reproduciblility", "Minimal", "Maximal"
)
```

## Comparing GDS with GIS

```{r}
knitr::kable(d)
```

## Spatial modelling CAN 'save the world' | But only if it's open and scientific

Reasoning:

- Evidence inevitably gets skewed by political aims

> - If the people doing the research are influenced by dominant political forces, findings will be biases for political gain (solved by independent well-funded public research).

- People doing policy relevant research watch out (regarding politicians):

> “Their very spirit undergoes a pervasive
transformation,” and they finally end up as “experts at exchanging smiles,
handshakes, and favors.” [@reclus_anarchy_2013, original: 1898]

## Importance of open data and methods

> - If the data underlying policy is hidden, it can be represented to push certain aims (solved by open data)

> - If the data is 'open' but the tools are closed, results open to political influence

> - Which brings us onto our next topic...

# Where will cycling uptake happen?

<!-- ## Context: from concept to implementation -->

<!-- A life-course of my involvement with the PCT -->

<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Concept of algorithms for cycling uptake (PhD 2009 - 2013) -->
<!--  Discovery of programming (R) and shiny (2013) -->
<!--   'Propensity to Cycle' bid by DfT via SDG (2014) -->
<!--     Start work w. Cambridge University and colleagues (2015) -->
<!--      Implementation on national OD dataset, 700k routes (2016) -->
<!--        Addition of school and near-market prototypes (late 2016) -->
<!--          LSOA phase (Malcolm Morgan) (early 2017) -->
<!--            ... -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--  > - 2018: (Global PCT?)  -->

## Prior work (source: Lovelace et al. 2017)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dft = readr::read_csv("~/npct/pct-team/data-sources/cycle-tools-wide.csv")
dft$Tool = gsub("Permeability Assessment Tool", "PAT", dft$Tool)
knitr::kable(dft)
```

## The PCT in government policy

Included in Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Strategy (CWIS) and the Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("~/npct/pct-team/figures/front-page-leeds-pct-demo.png")
```

## How the PCT works

Shows on the map where there is high cycling potential,
for 4 scenarios of change

- Government Target
- Gender Equality
- Go Dutch
- Ebikes

## Scenario shift in desire lines | Source: @lovelace_propensity_2017

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("~/npct/pct-team/flow-model/od-data-leeds.png")
```

- Origin-destination data shows 'desire lines'
- How will these shift with cycling uptake

## Scenario shift in network load

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

## A live demo for Sheffield | "Actions speak louder than words"

- See [www.pct.bike](http://pct.bike/south-yorkshire)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/npct/pct-team/flow-model/man-trinity-way-satellite.png")
```

## Follow-on work

Live demo of the Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit (CyIPT): https://www.cyipt.bike

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/cyipt/cyipt/blob/master/figures/recommended-york.png?raw=true")
```

## Globalisation of research | World Health Organisation funding for globally scalable toolkit

- If it can work in Sheffield, it can work anywhere.

> As a prominent Sheffield-based cycling advocate put it: ‘‘if cycling can work here, it
can work anywhere in the world’’ (Bocking, 2010, personal
communication) [@lovelace_assessing_2011] - see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.051

## A cycling network for Accra?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}

# Discussion: ensuring research is used for the greater good

## Points of discussion

It is clear that geographical research can have large policy impacts.

- That researchers can act to maximise the social benefit of the research
- That involves getting the evidence out to as many people as possible
- And using open source, accessible tools - the 'science' in GDS?

But many questions remain:

> - Where to draw the line between impartial research and advocacy?
> - To what extent should researchers open-sourcing their work defend against commercial exploitation?

## Final question

- What can you do to maximise the social benefits arising from your work?
